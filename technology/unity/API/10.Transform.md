## Transform
#### 1.Transform.Find ####
和弃用的Transform.FindChild方法类似。  

* 1.Finds a child by name and returns it.
* 2.If no child with name can be found, null is returned
* 3.If name contains a '/' character it will access the Transform in the hierarchy like a path name.

	gun = player.transform.Find("Gun").gameObject;  
	if (gun != null)
    {
        //Find the child named "ammo" of the gameobject "magazine" (magazine is a child of "gun").
        ammo = gun.transform.Find("magazine/ammo");
    }
